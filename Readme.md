# YelpCamp
* Yelpcamp is a node js website where users can look for campgrounds. Users also can add, remove, edit, and view both campgrounds and reviews if they are logged in.

* YelpCamp was the big project of colt steele's web development course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
  
#### The project is part of my web development journey. I may add more features if I have time.
